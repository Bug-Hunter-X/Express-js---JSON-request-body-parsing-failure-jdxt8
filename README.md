This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in Express.js applications where JSON request bodies are not parsed correctly. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected version. The issue arises from improper middleware placement or configuration of `express.json()`.  Ensure that `express.json()` is used before any route handlers that expect JSON data.
